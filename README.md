# Apex Agent Orchestrator (AAO)

A Salesforce‑native framework for building, running, and monitoring AI agents that take actions across Salesforce and external systems — with multi‑turn chat, long‑term memory, and full run observability built in.

## What This Project Is

A managed‑package‑ready orchestration layer that provides:

- **Multi‑step agent reasoning** — an async ReAct loop where each LLM/tool step runs in its own transaction, chained by platform events (no queueable depth limits)
- **Apex‑based tool execution** — CRUD, query, describe, and validation tools out of the box; new tools are one class + two Custom Metadata records
- **Multi‑agent collaboration** — agents delegate to sub‑agents via suspend/resume, with parallel tool fan‑out
- **Conversational sessions** — ChatGPT‑style threads: users reply and the agent remembers the conversation, with automatic history compaction for long threads
- **Long‑term memory** — agents extract durable facts and preferences from runs, recall them into future prompts, and learn lessons from their own successes and failures (pluggable store, Salesforce‑native today, vector‑ready)
- **LLM provider abstraction** — provider configs in Custom Metadata; OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and Azure OpenAI out of the box, new providers are one class + one factory branch
- **Full observability** — every run and step persisted, live progress events, a run monitor with cancel/re‑run, and a step‑by‑step trace viewer
- **Admin‑configurable agents** via Custom Metadata — prompts, tool grants, providers, and memory behavior are records, not code

## The Agent Orchestrator App

The included Lightning app ships six UI surfaces (LWCs):

| Tab              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Chat**   | Chat with any active agent: session sidebar, live "Calling QuerySalesforceTool…" progress, tool activity chips. Also embeddable on record pages (auto‑attaches the record as context).               |
| **Run Monitor**  | Live, filterable table of all runs with Cancel and Re‑run actions.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Agents**       | Agent builder: view or edit each agent's prompt, tools, provider, and memory config — edits deploy through the Metadata API with live status — plus a "what the LLM actually sees" manifest preview. |
| **Memories**     | What agents remember: users curate their own memories; admins curate everything, including the reflection lesson review queue.                                                                       |
| **Tool Catalog** | Every registered tool with input/output schemas, prompt guidance, and per‑agent grants.                                                                                                              |
| **Test Bench**   | Run any agent against an editable input JSON (savable samples) and watch the live step trace.                                                                                                        |

Plus the **Agent Run** record page trace: step timeline with expandable LLM request/response detail and the sub‑agent family tree.

## Core Components

- **AgentEngine** — the execution state machine: `runAgent` (one‑shot) and `runAgentInSession` (conversational) entry points, LLM/tool steps, parallel fan‑out, sub‑agent suspend/resume, cancel guards.
- **ToolRegistry / AgentTool** — discovers and invokes Apex tools; access is granted per agent via `Agent_Tool_Mapping__mdt`.
- **LLMClient / LLMClientFactory** — provider‑agnostic LLM interface driven by `LLM_Provider__mdt`; ships `OpenAIClient`, `AnthropicClient`, and `AzureOpenAIClient`.
- **AgentDeployService / AgentDeployCallback** — deploys agent definitions and tool grants from the builder UI via `Metadata.Operations`, reporting completion over the UI event channel.
- **MemoryProvider / MemoryService** — pluggable memory store (`Agent_Memory__c` + `SalesforceMemoryProvider` today); recall injects "Relevant memories" and "Lessons from previous runs" into prompts, `MemoryCaptureQueueable` extracts facts and reflections after runs.
- **HistoryCompactor** — summarizes long conversations before they hit the 128KB history ceiling, via a configurable cheap maintenance model.
- **ExecutionLogger** — persists every run (`Agent_Run__c`) and step (`Agent_Step__c`); the single termination choke point that releases sessions, resumes parents, and publishes UI events.
- **UIEventPublisher / Agent_UI_Event\_\_e** — live progress channel the LWCs subscribe to (with polling fallback).
- **AgentWatchdogSchedulable / MemoryJanitorSchedulable** — hourly timeout of stuck runs and orphaned sessions; nightly pruning of expired/stale memories.
- **Custom Metadata** — `Agent_Definition__mdt`, `Agent_Tool_Definition__mdt`, `Agent_Tool_Mapping__mdt`, `LLM_Provider__mdt`, `Memory_Config__mdt`.

## Permission Sets

- **AAO_Admin** — full access: all objects, all tabs, monitoring, builder, test bench.
- **AAO_User** — chat + own memories: start sessions, converse with agents, and curate what agents remember about them.

## Apex Reference Documentation

Apex classes are documented with [ApexDocs](https://github.com/cesarParra/apexdocs) via `/** @description ... */` comment blocks. The generated reference guide is a build artifact (`docs/apex/`, gitignored) — regenerate it locally whenever you want current docs:

```bash
npm install
npm run docs
```

This reads `apexdocs.config.mjs` and writes a Markdown reference guide to `docs/apex/`, grouped by architecture area (Agent Engine, Agent Tools, LLM Integration, Memory, UI, Tests). Open `docs/apex/index.md` as the entry point.

When adding or changing a public class, method, or constructor, add/update its `@description`/`@param`/`@return` ApexDoc comment so the generated docs stay accurate.

## Post-Install Setup

### 1. Grant the Automated Process User access to LLM credentials

Agent steps are chained via a Platform Event (`Agent_Step_Event__e`) so that long-running agents aren't limited by Apex's queueable chain-depth cap. As a side effect, the Queueable that performs the LLM callout is enqueued from the event trigger and therefore executes as the **Automated Process User**, not the user who started the run.

If your LLM provider's Named/External Credential (e.g. `OpenAI_Credential`) uses per-principal access control, you'll see a run fail with:

> We couldn't access the credential(s). You might not have the required permissions, or the external credential "..." might not exist.

To fix this, after installing the package:

1. Setup → Named Credentials → External Credentials → select your LLM provider's external credential.
2. Note the permission set(s) listed under **Permission Set Mappings**.
3. The Automated Process User is a restricted system user — you cannot open its User Detail page (you'll get an "Insufficient Privileges" error if you try). Instead, assign the permission set from the **permission set's** side:
   - Setup → Permission Sets → open the permission set with the External Credential Principal Access mapping.
   - Click **Manage Assignments** → **Add Assignment**.
   - Search for and select the **Automated Process** user, then save.
   - If the Automated Process user doesn't appear in that list for some reason, it can also be assigned via anonymous Apex:
     ```apex
     User automatedProcessUser = [SELECT Id FROM User WHERE UserType = 'AutomatedProcess' LIMIT 1];
     PermissionSet ps = [SELECT Id FROM PermissionSet WHERE Name = 'YOUR_PERMISSION_SET_NAME' LIMIT 1];
     insert new PermissionSetAssignment(AssigneeId = automatedProcessUser.Id, PermissionSetId = ps.Id);
     ```

If your external credential uses **Per-User** authentication, switch it to a **Named Principal** instead — the Automated Process User cannot complete a per-user OAuth flow.

**Named credentials per provider:** the shipped `LLM_Provider__mdt` records expect a named credential that injects the provider's auth header — `OpenAI_NC` (`Authorization: Bearer`), `Anthropic_NC` (`x-api-key`), `AzureOpenAI_NC` (`api-key`, with your deployment name and `api-version` in the record's endpoint path). Create the credential(s) for the providers you use and grant the Automated Process User access as above.

### 2. Schedule the background jobs

Two scheduled jobs keep runs and memories healthy: the **watchdog** (hourly — times out runs stuck `Running`, resumes suspended parents, releases stuck sessions) and the **memory janitor** (nightly — deactivates expired and stale memories). Schedule both with:

```bash
sf apex run --file scripts/apex/ScheduleWatchdog.apex --target-org <alias>
```

> **Deploy note:** scheduled Apex blocks class deployments. Either run `scripts/apex/UnscheduleWatchdog.apex` before deploying (and re-run the schedule script after), or enable _Allow deployments with active Apex jobs_ under Setup → Deployment Settings.

### 3. Assign permission sets

Assign **AAO_Admin** to builders/admins and **AAO_User** to anyone who should chat with agents, then open the **Agent Orchestrator** app from the App Launcher.

### 4. Configure memory (optional)

Each agent's `Agent_Definition__mdt.MemoryConfig__c` points at a `Memory_Config__mdt` record:

- **NoMemory** — recall and capture disabled.
- **Default_Memory** — fact extraction + reflection on, compaction at 90k chars, recall of up to 10 memories per run.

To cut token costs, set `Maintenance_Provider__c` on the config to a cheap model's `LLM_Provider__mdt` record — compaction, extraction, and reflection calls route there instead of the agent's main model.
